# üë©‚Äçüíª About

The present application is meant to demostrate the back end skills accuaried during the second section of UTSA_coding bootcamp, by appliying not only core concepts such as databases with sequelize, but also appliying a new file structure (NVC patter), which allows to apply important aspects of a website, such as log in, log out, or cookies, AKA sessions.

This time, based on the required criteria for the weekly challenge, it was required to create a blogpost that allow the user to signup, login, signout, create post, edit a post, delete a post, or add comments to the post, all of this, trying to keep a clean interface with a previously used CSS framework (bulma.CSS).

It's important to mention that the code present is deployed to heroku.
